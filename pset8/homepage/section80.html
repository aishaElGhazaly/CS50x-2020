                        <p class="note"> The rapper formerly known as K-Dot had built a buzz prior to his 2011 breakthrough album,
                            but the Compton native still had everything to prove: In spite of a coveted co-sign from Dr. Dre,
                            he was barely out of the shadow of his Top Dawg Entertainment labelmate Jay Rock, on whose tour Lamar
                            still regularly served as hype-man. Los Angeles’ old guard of gangsta rap greats was waning; the hottest
                            trend in L.A. rap around the time Lamar was forming his Black Hippy super-group (alongside Jay Rock, Ab-Soul,
                            and ScHoolboy Q) was the jerkin’ movement, a fun but frivolous dance craze. Los Angeles hip-hop needed a new
                            hero, and Lamar stepped up to the plate.<br>

                            <br>But Section.80 was far from a bid for mainstream attention. Over jazzy beats suited for contemplative
                            spells, Lamar raps like he’s searching, bar by bar, for answers to America’s biggest questions, turning a
                            critical eye on his own reality and the systems that reinforce it. The title itself combines Section 8 housing,
                            the low-income developments in which Lamar was raised, with the decade of Lamar’s birth; he thus fashioned
                            himself an ambassador for a generation raised under Ronald Reagan and the crack epidemic. “You know why we crack
                            babies? Because we born in the ’80s,” Lamar spits on lead single “A.D.H.D.,” a generational study as sharp as it
                            is catchy. Ultimately, though, Section.80 channels that unrest into a quest for enlightenment; on the knocking
                            “HiiiPower,” Lamar conjures visions of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X and urges listeners to “build your
                            own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs.” Upon the album's release, some listeners thought this stuff was too
                            radical for Lamar to ever fully break into the mainstream—but the maverick was on the threshold of something even
                            bigger.</p>

        <h1>F**k Your Ethnicity</h1>
        <hr>
<pre>
[Skit]
Gather around. I'm glad everybody came out tonight. As we stand on our neighborhood corner,
know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy,
come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... f**k your
ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of s**t that concerns you. All of you...
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Intro]
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a f**k, throw your hands up high
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Now I don't give a f**k if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean s**t to me
F**k your ethnicity, n***a
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 1]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the f**k are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
F**k that, n***a look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no f**king rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the f**king cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Interlude]
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Now I don't give a f**k if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean s**t to me
F**k your ethnicity, n***a
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 2]
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that a**, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big s**t I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Bridge]
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a b***h, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us
They'll die
Wizard
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Now I don't give a f**k if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean s**t to me
F**k your ethnicity, n***a

        <h1>Hol' Up</h1>
        <hr>
<pre>
[Verse 1]
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can f**k her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young n***a
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty b***hes, twenty million
And a Comptown fitted
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus 1]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big s**t popping — Section.80
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 2]
Back in this b***h, in the back of that b***h
With my back against the wall
And your b***h on the edge of my d**k—jump off!
I call a b***h a b***h, a h** a h**, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus 2]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big s**t poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, n***a, losing ain't a option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big s**t poppin' —
Hey, hey, kick her out the studio, Ali
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 3]
24/7, n***a working his a** for it, she popping that a** for
The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
She callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you n***as is past poor? You'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus 3]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big s**t poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, n***a, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big s**t poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, n***a
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Outro]
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can f**k her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol' up

[Intro]
Uh-uh, f**k that (f**k that)
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, f**k that
12 bottles in the case, n***a, f**k that
Two pills and a half-weight, n***a, f**k that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 1]
Man, I swear my n***a trippin' off that s**t again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a f**k? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some h**s)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, f**k that
12 bottles in the case, n***a, f**k that
Two pills and a half-weight, n***a, f**k that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Post-Chorus]
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 2]
And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23
"Okay, then we are crack babies."
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines."
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
And then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood."
"You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy."
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, f**k that
12 bottles in the case, n***a, f**k that
Two pills and a half-weight, n***a, f**k that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Post-Chorus]
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, h**s, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No make-up today, no make-up today
No make-up today, no make-up to...
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind

<pre>
[Verse 1]
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From heaven, is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her but when the make-up occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time

No make-up today, no make-up today
No make-up today, no make-up to...
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind

Concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction I've outgrown
I feel like it's not enough
I can never put on too much make-up
Yeah, I know your imperfections I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
Is that I had a black ey- To be continued... 11

Don't judge me

[Verse 1]
I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
She got a n***a and she love this n***a, well, at least I think
Everytime we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like:

<pre>
[Hook 1]
F**k them other n***as 'cause I'm down for my n***a
F**k them other n***as 'cause I'm down for my n***a
F**k them other n***as, I'll ride for my n***a
I'll die for my n***a, f**k them other...
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 2]
Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial
So when she got home, it was going down, she go:
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Hook 2]
F**k that other n***a when she tired of her n***a
F**k that other n***a when she tired of her n***a
F**k that other n***a when she tired of her n***a
Sick of lies from her n***a, f**k that other...

[Verse 3]
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the s**t
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big b**t, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like:
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Hook 1]
F**k them other n***as 'cause I'm down for my n***a

I'll die for my n***a, f**k them other...

<pre>
[Verse 4]
Until one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night
She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon':
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Hook 2]
F**k that other n***a when she tired of her n***a
F**k that other n***a when she tired of her n***a
F**k that other n***a when she tired of her n***a
Sick of lies from her n***a, f**k that other...

<pre>
[Verse 5]
And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that
It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning d**e, they:

Lightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the s**t that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs

[Verse 1]
I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My momma is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these n***as ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street n***a for real n***a
The same n***a that kill with ya will squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my n***as
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote
Hope it get you off Death Row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you...

[Refrain: GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real n***as with me
F**k the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 2]
You like to mistake a street n***a for real n***a
The same n***a that kill with ya will squeal with ya
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back and for that I give them my torso
You think about it; and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a n***a that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make their similes curve
My simplest s**t be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He'll probably be out of work, laid back, while he...

[Outro: GLC]
Church is definitely on the move
And now we done took it up to the cathedral
'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
We out here rotating under the five P's
Proper preparation prevents poor performance
You know what I'm talking 'bout? Doing my thing
'Cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets all the way out here
To the streets of Compton, know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move
And we gonna continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner
By the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
You gotta get up off your a** and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yo'self
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Exercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, church, "ism"

Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I ain't seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report

I was somewhere stuck where the flame is

Went broke and I came up in the same year, can I get a hell yeah?
Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride

Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album

Babies from 80's don't know—know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 1]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only 17
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give it all to her daddy but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 2]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 3]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
10 months before she was 10 he moved in
And that's when he touched her
This m********a is the f**king reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park
I seen the El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder
Left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you b*****d
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yessir (Amen!) Church
(He dead!) I killed him (Amen!) B***h
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 1]
And this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus; the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the s**t, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this f**king parasite
(He dead! Amen!) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrities, this is studio felony
Ferragami, so many, and cool enough for the '70s
N***a, payback's a b***h, and b***h you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all, and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
That say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I killed him
(He dead!) Hmh, hmh, hm (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you b*****d
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you b*****d
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 2]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
I'm persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my d**k in the rap industry
Everybody b***hing, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all f**ks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see
</pre><br>

(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons

(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen

A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a f**king liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wilding, a young'n with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems

Yeah, life can please you, but death can tease you
On the day Niko had that seizure

Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
But tease her 'bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, "They at it again"
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
"Momma, I just wanna sing"
Momma said, "According to get everything...
You gotta risk everything"
So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians

        <hr>

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I've seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me) One, two
Three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad b***h, f**k the penitentiary
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell (Oh)
Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh!)
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My n***a cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That martial law s**t drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope
Soul!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam
Life...

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn 1 'til 21 listen to Kendrick
For instance:
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story!
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, h**s, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent 23 years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead f**king center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, h**s, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human m*********ing being over dope-a** instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar!
Now f**k 'em up, Terrace!
(Soul!)

[Outro]
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
This is me
And we are HiiiPower

[Intro]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something, or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 1]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my d**k
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eating p****y that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the m********in' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other n***as wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you m********as waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Just call the s**t HiiiPoWeR
N***a, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, b***hes
I mean the s**t is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 2]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a f**king widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so f**king frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a f**king legend
Tryna be a f**king legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Just call the s**t HiiiPoWeR
N***a, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, b***hes
I mean the s**t is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Bridge: Alori Joh & (Kendrick Lamar)]
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Verse 3]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so f**king frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
</pre><br>

<pre>
[Chorus]
Just call the s**t HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, b***hes
I mean the s**t is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
</pre><br>
